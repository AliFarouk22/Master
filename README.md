<!-- ##Connect to Drive -->

## 1- Imports 
Import the needed libraries and packages. - to be run first -

## 2- Code to make results reproducable
Set the random seed of keras, tensorflow, and other libraries. - to be run second -

## 3- Read full image 224 x 224
Read the data set using batch by batch keras generator.

## 4- Model
The code to build the proposed model architecture.

## 5- Model 2
Another block to build different models using Keras Functional API. 


## 6- Compile Model
Combile the model and set the optimizer and metrics.

## 7- VGG layers weights to model
Initializing the Model weights with VGG-16 CNN that trained on ImageNet Dataset.

## 8- Run Model
Train the Model and save the best checkpoint.

## 9- Test
Read the test data using keras generator and use the proposed model after training in testing.
